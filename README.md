# FITTRAINER-24-MOBILE

As for this project, I started it in React Native, but before that I just designed and created the project in Figma, where I worked out what and how it should look. After the idea itself, I started to come up with which programming language I would use and which database I would use. In the end I chose React Native and MongoDB as the base.
