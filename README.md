# FITTRAINER-24-MOBILE

As for this project, I started it in React Native, but before that I just designed and created the project in Figma, where I worked out what and how it should look. After the idea itself, I started to come up with which programming language I would use and which database I would use. In the end I chose React Native and MongoDB as the base.

As for the project itself, my goal was to create a project to make it easier for new exercisers in the GYM. For example, which exercises to do or training programs, etc.

With that alone, my program has splits that the **USER** will be able to choose or buy. After that, he will be able to choose, that is, rent his coach, where there will be a list of all available coaches. There will be something like a map where the user will be able to see all the nearest gyms in their city and will be able to see which one is far from it.

But first of all, there will be a **login** and **registration** where the user will be able to log in and register. All data will be saved in the database.


On this link below you can see the UI design as I created it and how it will probably change over time, so if you have time, I am free for some criticism on how to improve the design:
